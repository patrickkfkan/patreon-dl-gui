## Path to Deno

The path to [Deno](https://deno.com) executable.

Deno is used by the built-in YouTube downloader to run third-party code in a sandboxed environment. It is optional but without it, the code runs without isolation, increasing the risk of security vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access, data corruption, or malicious behavior. For this reason, installing Deno is strongly recommended.

Set this option if you have Deno installed and the executable is not in the system's PATH.
