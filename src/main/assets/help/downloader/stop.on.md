When to stop the downloader.

If you choose "Previously downloaded item encountered", you must also enable "Use status cache" for this setting to be effective.

If you choose "Publish date of item out of specified range", you must also set the "Published" criteria under the "Include" -> "Posts" tab (or "Products", as the case may be) for this setting to be effective.
